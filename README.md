# Calendar To-Do
An application created to be used on a display tablet. This was created so I could place a motion activated tablet on my wall and have it show me my calendar and a to-do list. This application features a custom calendar, which allows the user to add items with a name, description, who it's for, start time, and end time. This app also features a To-Do list, which has a simple title and who it's for archetecture.

## Purpose
The purpose of the application was to create a solution for a tablet I had at home. All calendar apps I could find were too complex to be casually used in passing, and none of them featured a todo list within them.
